# Calculator Project

A simple calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This calculator comes with some unique features to enhance user experience and privacy.

## Features

### 1. Memory Cache

The calculator includes a memory cache that can store up to 10 frequently accessed expressions. This allows users to quickly retrieve and reuse previously entered calculations without having to retype them.

### 2. No Usage of `eval()`

Unlike some calculators, this project does not utilize the `eval()` function, ensuring better security and preventing potential vulnerabilities that might arise from executing arbitrary code.

## Demo

## Usage

1. Enter expressions using the calculator's interface.
2. Click up or down key on the keyboard to access cache to retrieve and reuse cached expressions.
